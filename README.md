CloudGallery
============

Cloud Gallery for Firefox OS. This is an experimental
implementation of a Gallery application for Firefox OS that can store images on the Cloud.
As a result, it allows to get access to your Gallery from any device which has a Web Browser.

The authentication is based on Facebook. The backend service is implemented in Node.js. To store data
Redis is used as well as an Object Storage Service provided by Telefónica.

This is an application made for experimentation purposes. Your gallery maybe lost and the service is not guaranteed at all.

Original ideas an implementation: José Manuel Cantera Fonseca (jmcf@tid.es)
